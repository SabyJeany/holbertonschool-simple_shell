# Simple Shell

## Description
This project is an implementation of a **simple Unix shell** in C language. It replicates the basic functionalities of a command interpreter like **sh** or **bash**.The aim of the project is to understand the internal workings of a shell:

- reading and parsing commands
- executing programs
- managing processes and signals
- interacting with the system environment

---

## CompilationThe shell is compiled with the following command

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
